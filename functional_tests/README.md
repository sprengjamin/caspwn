This folder contains functional test for the plane-sphere and sphere-sphere geometry.
The tests can be run by first creating test data by running

    bash create_test_data.sh

which stores the test data files in the subdirectory "test_data". After that one can then compare the newly generated data with the reference data by running

    python compare_results.py

The subfolder "reference_data" contains reference values for the energy of different setups. When necessary, this data can be generated by running

    bash create_reference_data.sh

One may want to delete the old reference data files before doing so.
